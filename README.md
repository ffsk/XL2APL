# XL2APL
Fast, light-weight utility to import Excel data into Dyalog APL.

This utility currently requires .NET for extracting files from zip archives directly into memory, and is thus Windows dependent. It is antipated that Dyalog will realease a .NET Core bridge in the future, making it platform independent. 

This utility does NOT require or make use of the Microsoft Open XML SDK.
